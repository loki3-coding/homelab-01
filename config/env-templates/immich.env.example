#    docker exec -i postgres psql -U postgres < apps/immich/init-db.sql
#    OR manually:
#    docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres
#    CREATE DATABASE immich;
#    CREATE USER immich WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your-password-here';
#    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE immich TO immich;

# 6. Start Immich: cd apps/immich && docker compose up -d
